## Reflection

This was a 5-week long project built during the React module at Nucamp Coding Bootcamp. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and implementing new features with the use of ourselves with the latest documentation.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 6.10, Redux, JavaScript, Reactstrap, Formik, Bootstrap, and CSS. We decided to use the npx create-next-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and maximize time building desired features within the site.

In the next iteration, we plan on improving user interface to maximize responsiveness on mobile devices, adding search feature functionality, and adding a backend portion to the site.
